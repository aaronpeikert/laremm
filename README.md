# laremm
This R package introduces LASSO regularization to Structural Equation Models built with OpenMx. 
It is created as part of my master thesis and it is still under depelopment. If you whish to perform LASSO regularization in
SEM, I recommend using the regsem package by Dr. Ross Jacobucci. 

# Installation

```{r, eval=FALSE}
